Sarah (PM): Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining today's product review. We have a lot to cover. Let's start with the Q1 roadmap discussion.

John (Engineering): Before we get into roadmap, I wanted to flag that we're seeing performance issues with the new search feature. Page load times increased by 40% since last release.

Sarah (PM): That's concerning. What's the root cause?

John (Engineering): The indexing is too aggressive. We're rebuilding the entire index on every update instead of incremental updates. I estimate it'll take 2 weeks to fix properly.

Sarah (PM): Okay, let's make that a P0. John, can you own the fix and target completion by end of month?

John (Engineering): Yes, I'll have a detailed plan by end of week.

Lisa (Design): On the roadmap front, I've finished the mockups for the mobile onboarding flow. Can we prioritize that for Q1?

Sarah (PM): Let's discuss. What's the business case?

Lisa (Design): Current mobile onboarding completion rate is 45%. Industry average is 70%. If we improve the flow, we could add 10k monthly active users.

Mike (Data): I can confirm those numbers. Mobile is our biggest growth opportunity right now.

Sarah (PM): Sounds good. Let's make mobile onboarding a Q1 priority. Lisa, can you work with John to estimate engineering effort?

Lisa (Design): Absolutely. I'll set up a follow-up meeting this week.

Sarah (PM): Great. One more thing - we need to make a decision on the pricing experiment. Mike, what do the results show?

Mike (Data): The $20/month tier is performing well. 12% conversion rate vs 8% for the $15 tier. Revenue per user is up 30%. I recommend we ship it.

Sarah (PM): Any concerns about churn?

Mike (Data): Churn rate is actually slightly better. Users at the higher price point seem more engaged.

Sarah (PM): Okay, decision made - we'll roll out the $20 tier to 100% of users next week. Mike, can you create the rollout plan?

Mike (Data): Will do. I'll have it ready by Thursday.

Sarah (PM): Perfect. Let's wrap up. To summarize: John is fixing search performance (P0, due end of month), Lisa and John are scoping mobile onboarding for Q1, and Mike is creating the pricing rollout plan. Any questions?

John (Engineering): One question - for mobile onboarding, are we doing iOS first or both platforms simultaneously?

Sarah (PM): Good question. Let's discuss in the follow-up meeting. Add that to the agenda.

Lisa (Design): Will do.

Sarah (PM): Great. Thanks everyone. I'll send out meeting notes and action items later today.
